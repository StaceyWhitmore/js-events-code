### 20 minute Presentation on (vanilla)JS Events
## Code for 20 min presentation I am giving on the JS event-driven programming model
## Notice the lesson's focus is on implementing events using plain vanillaJS and does Not make use of any JS libraries or frameworks.
#Here are some of the details for the lesson:

*SHOW your students a RESPONSIVE single page web page/application where the user will trigger an event and EXPLAIN the code to them.
*just using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
*The files doN'T NEED to be on a web server or remote hosting server. They can just be opened locally on the browser from the files you create.
*explain to your students the JavaScript CODE INVOLVED with an event TRIGGERED BY User Interaction with an Element on the page.
*Something simple, like when a Button is Clicked an Image Appears
* or when an Image is Clicked it Changes to Another Image, etc.
